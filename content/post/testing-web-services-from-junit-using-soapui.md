There is no doubt that <a href="http://www.soapui.org/">SoapUI</a> is a superb tool for testing Web Services. Yet, some people&nbsp;seem to think that SoapUI is&nbsp;just&nbsp;used for manual testing.&nbsp;In addition to manual tests, SoapUI supports automated tests, that is, test suites. Test suites are a step in the right direction towards automation but running them still requires human intervention. In other words, the user still has to launch SoapUI and click on the "Run..." button.&nbsp;This doesn't go down well in a&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration">CI</a> environment.<br /><br />Since SoapUI is a Java application, test suites can be invoked directly from JUnit removing the need for human intervention. On my GitHub page, I've uploaded a <a href="https://github.com/claudemamo/soapui-junit">project</a> that demonstrates how to do this. The project has a JUnit test case that launches a SoapUI mock Web Service and then invokes the test suite for it. Let me give a brief overview on how I went about developing the project.<br /><br />The first step was to set up a SoapUI project and test suite based on a WSDL.&nbsp;There's plenty of <a href="http://www.soapui.org/Functional-Testing/structuring-and-running-tests.html">documentation</a> online on how to do this. In the test suite, I created a test case for each WSDL operation:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-E8Gm5gHhTQ8/UIOr6msI7PI/AAAAAAAAADk/aUTSXKzPQDg/s1600/calculator-ws-test-suite.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-E8Gm5gHhTQ8/UIOr6msI7PI/AAAAAAAAADk/aUTSXKzPQDg/s400/calculator-ws-test-suite.png" width="393" /></a></div><br />For every test case, I asserted that the SOAP response isn't a SOAP fault, complies with the schema, it's a valid SOAP response and the outcome of the operation is correct:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xsIDeASGSDA/UIOtkDZ-HvI/AAAAAAAAAD4/dzuz9_53nrI/s1600/add-operation-test-case.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="335" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xsIDeASGSDA/UIOtkDZ-HvI/AAAAAAAAAD4/dzuz9_53nrI/s400/add-operation-test-case.png" width="400" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div>The next step was to create a mock Web Service in the same project so I have something to run the test suite against. Again, there is <a href="http://www.soapui.org/Getting-Started/mock-services.html">documentation</a> out there on this.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3pfxvgi8E-w/UIPgEOx2nBI/AAAAAAAAAEI/A2b9rD42uVw/s1600/mock-ws.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="342" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3pfxvgi8E-w/UIPgEOx2nBI/AAAAAAAAAEI/A2b9rD42uVw/s400/mock-ws.png" width="400" /></a></div><br />Now it was time to start developing the JUnit test case. I could have imported into my Java project the SoapUI libraries from the SoapUI distribution. But being a sadist, I decided to use Maven : P.&nbsp;In the project's POM, I declared the repo where to find SoapUI and its dependencies:<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/claudemamo/3914958.js?file=pom-1.xml"></script> I then declared the dependencies that I want to be retrieved and included in the classpath:<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/claudemamo/3914958.js?file=pom-2.xml"></script> The last step was to write the test for my Web Service:<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/claudemamo/3914958.js?file=CalculatorServiceTestCase.java"></script><i> testCalculatorService</i> is annotated with <i>@Test</i> which instructs the JUnit runner to execute the test. What the test does is simple:<br /><ol><li>It loads the test suite and mock Web Service configurations from the SoapUI project <i>calculator-soapui-project.xml</i></li><li>Launch the mock Web Service</li><li>Execute the test suite</li></ol>You can run the test by typing in your console "mvn test" in the project root directory.
