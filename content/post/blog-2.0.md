After a long time of inactivity, I've decided to give my blog a facelift. Among the changes
you'll notice is the spanking [new domain name](http://oncodesign.io). I'll still ramble about open-source software
though I'll be rambling about other subjects as well. A special thanks goes to [Anthony](http://www.anthony-galea.com/), a former
colleague of mine who recommended technologies I should consider as part of the blog revamp.
One of them being the hosting provider: the blog is no longer on Blogger but it's now hosted on [GitHub
Pages](https://github.com/claudemamo/claudemamo.github.io), giving me more control over
content.

Speaking of content, if you're wondering how I'm publishing it, I'm using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
for this purpose. The static site generator has excellent docs and gives you step-by-step instructions on
how to set it up for different hosting providers like GitHub Pages and BitBucket.
A bonus to using Hugo is that it has a [tool](https://github.com/natefinch/blogimport) to convert
posts from Blogger to Markdown which then can be imported into Hugo. So if you're
after my old posts, you'll find them on the new blog.

Of course, I'll keep using [AddThis](http://www.addthis.com/) so readers
can share content. Besides this, readers can comment on posts from [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) which
is apparently all the rage now.

Between work and enjoying the sizzling summer in Malta, I hope to find time to share thoughts on code
and design so subscribe to the new blog's RSS feed to stay tuned on the latest content.
