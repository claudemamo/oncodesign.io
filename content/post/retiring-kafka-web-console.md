I've been a busy bee the past few months. The lack of activity on my blog and GitHub is a testament to this. Given my current priorities, I've taken the decision to retire <a href="https://github.com/claudemamo/kafka-web-console" target="_blank">Kafka Web Console</a>. Don't despair yourself! <a href="https://github.com/yahoo/kafka-manager" target="_blank">Kafka Manager</a> appears to be a more sophisticated alternative to what I've developed, and besides, it's maintained by Yahoo.
