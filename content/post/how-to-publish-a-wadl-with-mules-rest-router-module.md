It seems to me that Mule's <a href="http://www.mulesoft.org/extensions/rest-module" target="_blank">REST Router module</a>, which I've previously <a href="http://ricston.com/blog/?p=2607" target="_blank">blogged</a> about, is gaining popularity as a viable alternative to the Jersey module. Yet, the REST Router has a serious limitation in that it's unable to generate a <a href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/wadl/" target="_blank">WADL</a>: the REST equivalent of a WSDL. Recently, I had to overcome this limitation owing to a customer requirement for producing client code from the WADL.<br /><br />Consider the Mule config below:<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/claudemamo/5215459.js?file=mule-config-1.xml"></script>The REST Router processes HTTP requests that have a URL path matching the <i>templateURI</i> pattern attribute. Non-matching requests are ignored by the router and passed on to the subsequent message processor which in this case is a static component. Each nested block in the router corresponds to an HTTP method. A GET request is processed by the <i>rest-router:get</i> element, a PUT request is processed by the <i>rest-router:put</i> element, and so on.<br /><br />WADL generation isn't a feature supported by the REST Router. If I was using the Jersey module in this example, I'd get the service WADL on hitting the URL <i>http://localhost:8081/application.wadl</i>. Although I'd like to avoid using Jersey for various reasons, I could leverage the library's WADL generation feature:<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/claudemamo/5215459.js?file=mule-config-2.xml"></script>The above modified Mule config routes WADL requests to Jersey and all other requests to the REST Router. Upon receiving a WADL request, Jersey returns the WADL derived from the JAX-RS annotated&nbsp;<i>org.ossandme.CommentResource</i>.&nbsp;<i>CommentResource</i> describes in Java the same RESTful interface described by the REST Router. Since all service logic is performed by the REST Router, I implement the resource as a Java interface instead of a class:<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/claudemamo/5215459.js?file=CommentResource.java"></script>This example is a Maven project hosted on <a href="https://github.com/claudemamo/mule-rest-wadl" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. To run it, (1) open your console and enter from the project root's directory:<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/claudemamo/5215459.js?file=build.sh"></script>(2) Then deploy the package on Mule 3.3.x standalone runtime. Accessing the URL&nbsp;<i><a href="http://localhost:8081/application.wadl">http://localhost:8081/application.wadl</a></i>&nbsp;will give you the following:<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/claudemamo/5215459.js?file=application.wadl"></script>
