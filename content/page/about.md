My first job after finishing the MSc. was writing training material about an open-source
framework used in several organisations. I never thought of myself as a gifted writer
and I certainly preferred writing code than documenting it. Despite of all this, I felt
a certain sense of clarity about the framework while drawing diagrams for presentation
slides and writing accompanying training manuals. A kind of clarity I wouldn't
obtain only by reading books or sitting at classes. My theory is that the act of
writing forced me to address the weaknesses in the model of understanding I had
in my head about the framework.

I created this blog to improve my understanding of software as well as
share my thoughts with the rest of the community. Fellow professionals I follow include [Martin Fowler](http://martinfowler.com/),
[Dan North](http://dannorth.net/), and [Fred George](https://twitter.com/fgeorge52).

If you like how my thought processes work and think I can be of help to your
organisation, you can get in touch with me by connecting on [LinkedIn](https://mt.linkedin.com/in/claudemamo).
