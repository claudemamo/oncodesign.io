      <description>&amp;ldquo;CXF scares the sh**t out of me!&amp;rdquo;.&amp;nbsp;This was a client&amp;rsquo;s comment during our discussion on&amp;nbsp;Apache CXF and I think it&amp;rsquo;s a feeling shared by many. This feeling usually arises from a complaint I hear on CXF: the lack of documentation. However, I suspect that CXF&amp;rsquo;s flexibility confuses numerous newbies and therefore contributes to the negative feelings towards it.&amp;nbsp;The bad news is that, for some, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to live without CXF. Popular open source software such as Apache Camel, Mule, and JBoss AS rely on CXF for their out-of-the-box web service support.</description>
