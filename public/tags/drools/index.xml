      <description>Rules are used for a variety of stuff in the systems we build. Most often these rules are hard-coded in our application logic. The trouble is that sometimes we want to have the end-user the ability to define his own rules. Imagine an order processing system. The supplier wants to be notified on any range of events as they occur throughout the system but the notification rules are not known ahead of time.</description>
