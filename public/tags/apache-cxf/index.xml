      <description>It seems to me that Web Services don&amp;rsquo;t receive much love from Rubyists. In fact, of the two Ruby projects I know that add Web Service support (SOAP4R and ActionWebService), both appear to be inactive. Someone might say that if Web Services are a must, then avoid Ruby or put an integration layer between your Ruby application and the client/service. From my experience, life is not always that simple and these solutions might not be applicable.</description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;re probably asking yourself&amp;nbsp;one of these two questions on reading this post&amp;rsquo;s title:
Who in his right mind would use SOAP as a data format for ØMQ?Why the heck would I want to have SOAP on top of ØMQ as opposed to HTTP?For the first question, consider a system requiring:
A return address pattern such as the one offered by JMS&amp;nbsp;and MSMQ.Guaranteed message delivery.&amp;nbsp;Encryption and authentication of messages.ØMQ wasn&amp;rsquo;t designed to cover these requirements so it&amp;rsquo;s up to the developer to come up with a solution.</description>
