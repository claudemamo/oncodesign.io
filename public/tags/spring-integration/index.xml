      <description>I&#39;ve been working with open source projects for a couple of years now and I&#39;ve come to expect two things from such projects:A set of working examples that comes with the distribution, and aQuick guide on getting started.Mule has them. ServiceMix has them. So why not Spring Integration? It&#39;s&amp;nbsp;a shame because I heard a lot of good things about the software. I couldn&#39;t find a reason why SpringSource didn&#39;t post an official guide on getting started quickly in their main page.</description>
