      <description>Hearing the words Mule and Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s MSMQ in the same sentence sends a shiver down my spine. I remember once, Mule guru John D&amp;rsquo;Emic and me had spent a considerable amount of time and patience getting Mule and MSMQ to talk to each other through DCOM. The major factor that contributed to this unpleasant experience was our ignorance of the numerous security measures imposed by Windows to restrict DCOM access. The morale of this story is unless you have a veteran Windows administrator at your disposal, avoid the DCOM route.</description>
