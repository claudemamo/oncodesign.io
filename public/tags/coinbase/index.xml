      <description>Last weekend, as part of my new year&amp;rsquo;s resolution to dedicate some time to good causes, I participated in Hack4good: a global 48 hour hackathon aimed at bringing ideas for the social good into life. In Malta, our team brought forward a crowd funding solution for charitable fundraisers with minimal transaction fees. To this end, we selected BitCoin as the donation currency and Coinbase to host fundraise donations.
One requirement in our project was to have Coinbase automatically issue a BitCoin wallet to each&amp;nbsp;fundraiser.</description>
