      <description>Last week I observed one of the 8 fallacies of distributed systems in action:
&#34;Topology doesn&#39;t change&#34;A client of mine deployed the latest versions of his web services to a highly-available QA environment. Sanity tests gave initial confirmation that the system was behaving as expected. But then, the QA team reported weird behaviour in the system&#39;s offline functionality. So I was called in the figure out the problem. The logs showed an application getting random HTTP 401s from the system&#39;s token service.</description>
